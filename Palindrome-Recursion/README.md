# Instructions

Write a recursive function that takes in a string "word" and determines if the string is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome return the boolean true; if it is not a palindrome return the boolean false. 

For reference, a palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards and forwards. 

**Examples**

```js
palindrome("racecar") ==> true
palindrome("conifer") ==> false
```
