# Instructions

A prime number is a positive integer with no divisors besides itself and 1 (it cannot be divided without a reminder by any number besides itself and 1). Write a function to check whether a given positive integer greater than 1 is prime or not.

**Examples**

```js
isPrime(3) => true
isPrime(5) => true
isPrime(10) => false (divided evenly by 2 and 5)
```

Look into using the modulus (%) operator
