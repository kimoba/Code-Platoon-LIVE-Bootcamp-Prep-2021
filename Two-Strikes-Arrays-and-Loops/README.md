# Instructions

Write a method that takes in a string array of license plate numbers. The method should return a string array of any plate numbers that appeared at least twice. If none of the plate numbers appeared more than once, the method should return an empty array.

**Example**

```js
twoStrikes(['1AS5GB7', '345B317', '5A22845', 'AU73671', '345B317']) ==> ['345B317']
twoStrikes(['1AS5GB7', '345B317', '5A22845', 'AU73671']) ==> []
```
