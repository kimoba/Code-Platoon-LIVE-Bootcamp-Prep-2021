## Course Content

Bootcamp Prep is specifically designed to teach you 2 things.

* Javascript Fundamentals
* Problem Solving

These two skills are paramount to becoming a software developer and being accepted into Code Platoon. Specifically, your Problem Solving ability. When most people start learning to code they just learn the syntax of a language and then when it comes time to actually solve coding challenges they immediately get stuck and give up. Bootcamp Prep is designed to help you develop your problem solving skills by giving you coding challenges that put you to the test.
