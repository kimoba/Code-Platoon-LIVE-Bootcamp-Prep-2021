# Instructions

In order to be elected president in the United States you need to meet certain qualifications such as being at least 35 years old and being a natural-born citizen of the U.S. 

Write a method that takes in the last name, the age, and the country of origin for a presidential candidate (in that order) and returns a boolean true if that candidate has the potential to be president or  false if they do not.

**Example**

```js
eligibleForPrez("Clinton", 65, "United States") ==> true
eligibleForPrez("O'Shaughnessy", 20, "Ireland") ==> false
```
